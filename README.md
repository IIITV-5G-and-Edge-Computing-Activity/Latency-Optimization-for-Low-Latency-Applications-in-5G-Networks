## Project Overview

5G networks enable a wide variety of applications, such as augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, and real-time gaming, that require ultra-low latency. Traditional latency optimization methods are static and cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions. This project uses reinforcement learning to optimize latency dynamically by adjusting routing paths and prioritizing resources based on real-time network conditions.

The RL agent learns to minimize latency by interacting with a simulated 5G network environment, where it chooses between routing paths and observes the effects on latency for latency-sensitive applications.

## Features
- Simulated 5G network environment for latency optimization.
- Q-learning-based reinforcement learning agent for dynamic decision-making.
- Real-time adjustment of routing paths to minimize latency.
- Performance evaluation through cumulative latency metrics and adaptive behavior.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the RL model and environment.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Gym**: For creating a custom RL environment to simulate network behavior.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/latency-optimization-5g.git
   cd latency-optimization-5g
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### Training the Model
Run the training script to train the Q-learning agent:
```bash
python train.py
```
This script trains the reinforcement learning agent in a simulated environment to optimize latency by learning optimal routing decisions.

### Testing the Model
After training, run the test script to evaluate the model's performance:
```bash
python test.py
```
The script simulates the RL agent’s performance in reducing latency and displays cumulative latency metrics.
